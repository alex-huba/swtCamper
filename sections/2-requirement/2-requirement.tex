\emph{Document and analyze the software's functional requirements, 
non-functional requirements and development constraints. In particular, state 
whether a requirement is derived from the project brief, is an assumption made 
by your team, or has been added by the client. You may apply any documentation 
and analysis technique taught in module SWT-FSE-B or from the requirements 
engineering literature, including techniques based on user stories, use cases 
and prototyping. Properly reference and justify all employed techniques.}
