As a software development approach, we chose the agile, iterative process framework Scrum. In Scrum, the development process is structured in so called “sprints”, meaning (in our case) two-week long periods with a set goal (specific User Stories), a mid-sprint meeting, a meeting with the customer and a review meeting at the end. By doing this, we are able to, every two weeks, state a goal and present its fulfillment at the end of the sprint. The high frequency of meetings heightened the transparency in communication, leading to less misunderstandings, discarded work products and surprises in the form of changing requirements (instead of presenting one big end goal and getting feedback for all of it, we can regularly present small increments which get a small amount of feedback, which can be implemented immediately). Another benefit is the customer “seeing what they pay for”, i.e., continuous work. This, in the end, leads to a much higher customer satisfaction. To organize our work process we used the version control software git and the platform GitLab.
