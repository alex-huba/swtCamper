This sprint had a slow start because everyone was after new year holidays. However, after a few daily meetings all team members came back to original tempo of work. We defined a few optional tasks and tried to complete them in order to enhance the functionality and imporve the qualtiy of the product.

Also, our team realized that our code suffers from the lack of unit- and intergration-tests. That is why each member decided to create tests for the service classes which they have implemented earlier. 
All team members agreed that it would be much better if we implemented tests in parallel of implementation of the source code. It was hard and stressfull to creat so much test in a row.

It is worth to mention that we implemented a simple hashing of passwords in our application, which is undoubtedly a plus for our product. We found out that privacy and security play important role too in the software development and in future we will always try to take care about such things.

During this sprint, we demonstrated the experience we gained during the module in the area of time management and smart workload distribution among all team members.
