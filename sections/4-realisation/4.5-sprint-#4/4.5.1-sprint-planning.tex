After discussing with the entire team, the state our application was in,
 we set clear goals for the fourth sprint during the sprint planning 
 meeting. Also, we considered the customer's and client’s comments and
synchronized them with our goals accordingly.\\Generally speaking, development team was aimed at the following goals during the fourth sprint: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Provider shall be able to exclude unwanted renters (with bad renting history e.g.) in order to avoid negative consequences of careless usage of provider’s vehicle.
	\item Operator shall be capable of blocking unwanted providers or renters so that on the portal will be no unsuccessful deals.
	\item Operator shall have the means for manipulating the search results on the portal in order to promote specific offers. 
	\item Renter shall be able to view the booking history for tracking the expenses on the portal.
	\item Portal shall have visible notifications for users in order to highlight important processes for specific users.
	\item User’s data shall be secured. Especially, passwords in the database shall be hashed in order to upgrade security level of the portal. 
	\item Improve the quality of the code through the creation of unit and integration tests and detailed documentation in order to simplify the process of adding new functionality to the application and for facilitating the maintenance of the application in the future.
\end{enumerate}
So, as can be seen from this list, the work during fourth sprint was dedicated to 
user management from provider and operator perspective, booking history for renter, 
search results manipulations for operator and improving user experience through 
adding notifications and securing user’s data.  

The goal has four directions, which gives 
main stakeholders a significant amount of portal management tools, expands the 
capabilities of the user's personal account. Features dedicated to the visual 
component and security are implemented to attract a wider audience of users after 
the deploying the application.
