\emph{Describe and justify the development approach taken and the artefacts produced in this sprint (e.g., prototypes).  State any peculiarities of this sprint, such as peculiarities  regarding (i)~adopted development practices, (ii)~encountered obstacles, (iii)~questions that arose and needed clarification possibly from the client, or (iv)~important aspects regarding --- or changes to --- your software architecture, your algorithms or your techniques applied to solve a technical problem.}

We have broken down the functionalities far too
much into their individual parts (e.g. each controller or view individually named); This meant
that team members could not work independently on their issues because they had to wait
for others who had the same problem themselves. This “deadlock-like” condition was also an
important part of our retrospective.

You can also see that in addition to the user stories, work was also carried out on issues that
were either improvements from Sprint 0 or that are important for the project itself (such as
the design of a prototype or the redesign of our project plan).
The move from the xTasks skelleton to swtcamper, as already mentioned in the Sprint Goal,
has also been processed. Unfortunately, the order in which we carried out the merge
requests afterwards led to serious problems that we will also take with us into the next sprint
and work on there.
The better solution probably would have been to carry out all merge requests first and only
then to move to swtcamper. We did it the other way around.

Docker did not run on Windows 7
➔ a team member worked on other tasks first and bought a new PC by now
o MainController can't be implemented without the other Controllers
➔ good and early conversation in the team made it possible anyway
o IntelliJ had problems with JavaFX
➔ the help desk found out that this particular error came from the use of a wrong
sub folder
o Correct usage of branches
➔ a team member gave the others a quick introduction into Gitlab’s ‚Create Merge
Request‘ from within the issue itself and also showed how to work on Merge
Requests
o how to upload pictures with Java(FX)
➔ a team member still had the source code from another project that included this
feature, too, so this functionality could be transfered
o IntelliJ shows Class as not existent - even if it is
➔ This problem is not fixed until today but since it’s only from IntelliJ’s linter it
works anyway, but stays annoying
o „Merge Hell“ – should have done „clear codebase to skeleton“ after merging
everything, not started with everything else and merge it into new /swtcamper/
➔ As already stated, this problem is coming with us into Sprint 2 and has to be
worked on further
