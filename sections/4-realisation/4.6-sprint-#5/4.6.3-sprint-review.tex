In the last Sprint review meeting, first a presentation about the completed product was given, and after the presentation the software itself was also shown to client and customer. All important functionalities were provided:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Place an Offer
    \item Update an Offer
    \item Search and filter
    \item Booking an offer
    \item Highlight an offer
\end{itemize}


As there were three types of roles (Operator, Provider and Renter) 3 instances of the program were run to show the event cycle of each role.\\

After the important functionalities, a couple of optional ones were also presented such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logging history in the database and also for download
    \item password hashing for higher security (for sake of simplicity only in MD5)
    \item FAQ section
\end{itemize}


The customer and the client were happy with the result provided. The customer had only two questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why was prefered MD5-Hash method?\\
    As this task was optional, it was decided not to waste a lot of time and the simplest option was chosen. The customer explained that this hashing method is long outdated and is considered very risky to use especially in web applications.
    \item How was predicted goal measurement?\\
    A rough approximation has been calculated based on our assumptions about how the area works.
\end{enumerate}
