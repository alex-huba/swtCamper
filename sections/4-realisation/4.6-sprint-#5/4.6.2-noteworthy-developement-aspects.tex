In this sprint, despite the fact that we only had one user story, but many other tasks were done, which can be seen in the top table. These tasks included topics like: writing integration and unit tests for the services, reviewing code, fixing bugs, adjusting "read me, documentation and specification" files, etc.\\

The team had problems in the implementation of the tests. It was then decided to call on the support of the department's SWT. Kerstin Jakob prepared examples for the team for each type of test. Further on in Mid-Sprint she showed and explained to us how to implement the tests correctly.She also explained the clear difference between integration and unit tests.
