In this sprint, we only had one user story left to be done, but were able to do many other tasks anyway, which can be seen in the top table. These tasks included topics like writing integration- and unit tests for our Service classes, reviewing code, fixing bugs, adjusting 'read me', 'documentation' and 'specification' files, etc.\\

The team had problems in the implementation of the tests. It was then decided to call on the support of the department's SWT. Kerstin Jakob prepared examples for the team for each type of test. Further on in the Mid-Sprint meeting she showed and explained to us how to implement the tests correctly. She also explained the clear difference between integration and unit tests.
