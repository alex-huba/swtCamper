# xTASKS (Serves as a skeleton.)

The purpose of the xTASKS demo project is to provide a working application that highlights a number of useful technologies for your SWL project.

* A fully configured SpringBoot-based backend and a JavaFX-based frontend. 
* An included build file to compile, test, and run this project.
* Source code comments in the form of JavaDoc describing the workings of each method/class. 
* Contained unit and integration tests that provide good examples on how to test the code.
* A preconfigured GitLab CI pipeline that builds/tests the software, and checks for formatting issues automatically.
